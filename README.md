# Mapty-App

This project includes OOP, leaflet library, geolocation APÄ° and more...

I understood concept behind the ES6 classes and how it works behind the scenes, and how to use public and private classes.

Moreover, this project shows how to handle with "this" keyword, class instances and prototypal inheritance.

Codes is writen by me, but the project not belongs to me.

This is Jonas Schmedtmann's project which is created for learning purposes.

As an extra, I added deleting objects feature to the project.
